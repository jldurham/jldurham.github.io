###A contextual inquiry study to find solutions for communication breakdowns in a large academic organization.

## the problem

The College of Pharmacy is the University of Michigan’s center of education for future pharmacists and pharmaceutical scientists. The college is large and widespread, with a good amount of its students and faculty working in the community. There are many departments, who function fairly autonomously, and operate under a collection of deans and administrative directors. Our team was approached at a time when the college was undergoing overhauls to their central office space, as well as their website.

**We were asked to study the flow of information policy and procedure, which several people maintain from different departments of the college**. There were many formats for sharing and storage, and a multitude of key documents involved in the problematic information flow. Users range from current employees and students to new, incoming employees and students who rely on the student and faculty handbooks for policy and guidance. The college is organized in a decentralized fashion both physically and virtually, and they lack an efficient intranet for communication and information exchange.

The **key problems** we identified were:

* It is difficult for staff and faculty to find electronic documents and records in the shared drive of the college, which is the main repository of files for sharing and retrieving information; they do not have an efficient tool for accomplishing related functions and tasks.  
* Communication flow is inefficient and there is a lack of coordination between staff regarding information policy and procedures; there is no mutual understanding of how their college-wide system works and the tools used by staff.
* Many tools are obsolete and unused or infrequently used, while others are used but with difficulty.

## the solution

Our **first recommendation** was to develop a classification scheme or taxonomy for their analog and electronic records. This classification scheme would let them organize their electronic records in a subjective way because it is based on functions performed by the college. They should organize a research effort for identifying functions, subfunctions, processes and tasks, and use the names of this taxonomy (functions and subfunctions) to name the folders and subfolders, namely series or genres and case files. We advised that organizing the shared drive and reallocating all files could be a hard and even unnecessary task, so our proposal was that the college should make a backup of the whole shared drive and create a new organization of the drive by including new created records and documents inside the folder considering the new classification. Older records and documents, if needed, could be retrieved from the aforementioned backup. 

Our **second recommendation** was to use a content management system to control the updating of multiple handbooks and policy documents. We determined a component CMS (CCMS) would be the best fix, as these systems specialize in the creation of documents from component parts. A CCMS would allow users to assemble individual component topics into a map structure, and these components can be reused by other documents or across multiple documents. In this case, CoP could just update all the sections once and mapping the common sections and particular sections to form the handbooks they want. Additionally, one staff member should be designated to handle the handbook updating process, while driving and directing people to finish their work on the handbook more efficiently. 

Our **third recommendation** was to analyze the existing state of tools and take necessary actions, such as the following:

* Unused tools which are not effective should be removed to avoid confusion. If there is a particularly effective tool, for example the internal blog, its use should be encouraged for tasks like broadcasting college wide news.
* The college must slowly migrate from their obsolete tools to newer tools they already use. A set of standard software during orientation can be useful to maintain this task throughout the community. This would also avoid the inconsistency in software usage across the departments too. 
* Files that have not been updated for a long time should be remodeled to fit the current situation and help in easier data entry and avoid repetition of task. 
Proper documentation for hard to use tools can be a simpler solution for the current software that is hard to use. If not, simpler alternatives can be researched and be introduced either to the website or as a separate application.


## the process

After we determined our project management and created a GANTT chart to guide our work, we began gathering information about the organization and mapping it. We visited and observed the college and users of the system, and **conducted interviews** with several employees at the College of Pharmacy. Two interviews were conducted with the director of human resources and administration operations, as she is the staff member most directly involved with processes examined for our project. The other interviewees included: project coordinator of dean’s office, business office manager, director of admissions and student counseling services, manager of IT services, experiential education program manager, and research program officer. Most of these staff members are responsible for the direction of workflow within specific areas of the organization, so the information received in interviews provided a broad outline of the information breakdown at the college. We also learned about how each department interacts with shared information and documents, as well as those in other areas of the organization. Some interviewees were able to share details of their department’s own attempts to improve their information systems in the past year.

**Interpretation sessions** followed each interview, in which we gathered the information communicated during our meetings with staff and converted it into models. We processed the information into **affinity notes**, and we used artifacts and images to create various models. The **models we created included an artifact, flow, swimming lane, physical and cultural assessment models**.  These models were then consolidated to present various elements of our project in a succinct and useful manner.

Our models revealed the huge number of activities and processes within the organization, but most importantly, they also indicated that a lot of information relevant to these processes is common to several areas of the college. It was not surprising to find that their shared drive is disorganized and fragmented, and that every service and department has problems sharing, managing and retrieving their own information and data. Complicating matters further, there were a myriad of communication means used by the college: blog, website, UM's learning management system, internal website, email and paper shuffling. There were also several different operating systems used by faculty and staff. Our consolidated model narrowed these far-reaching issues down to the most essential points of concern, guided our path through these complicating factors as we brainstormed our recommendations.

As an additional aid to process our gathered information, we sorted our affinity notes into logical categories to create an **affinity wall**. This sorting method allowed us to convert the notes and models into an organized perspective, which then allowed for a more methodical analysis of the data. The director of human resources toured the wall and provided feedback and questions that helped to create an even deeper understanding of the issues at hand.

When we selected our recommendations, we narrowed down the major categories of analysis into what we felt were the three most significant approaches toward a solution at the college. These **findings and recommendations** were not precise directives, but rather a general guidance towards resolving the information flow issues at the college. Our recommendations were not extraordinarily surprising and ambitious, but rather satisfyingly articulated the needs and objectives for the system that would better satisfy it's users.

## the result

Throughout our work, the college was supportive towards any necessary changes that would increase efficiency, as they are an organization that does important and diverse work, and was quite aware of the need for improvement in their policies and procedures for information flow.  The college had already identified some of their problems at the point of seeking our consultation, so the process of solving their problems was essentially underway before your work even began. It was our hope that with this additional insight, evidence and discovery, they would be able to accomplish their goals of becoming a better-integrated and more cohesive organization. **Our recommendations were received with enthusiasm when formally presented to key stakeholders, and provided the foundation and research that their internal web task force used to create a plan for restructuring their intranet, shared drive, and website. **
