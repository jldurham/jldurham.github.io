###A usability study to evaluate the user needs of the university of michigan's largest archive's website

## the problem

Established in 1935, the Bentley Historical Library is the campus archive of the University of Michigan and is located on its North Campus. The Bentley serves as a key archival repository for the state of Michigan, and its user base ranges from those associated with the University to anybody seeking information on Michigan and wider topics. The website is the main access point for both those unable to physically visit the archive and those on-site conducting research. 

The website is used primarily to access and learn about the Bentley’s collections and to gain information on donating materials. It provides logistical information related to the physical site, policies and procedures, finding aids and search tools, and links to exhibits and digital collections. 

There are three main types of users of the Bentley’s website:

* Advanced researchers, including professionals (researchers-for-hire, research assistants), students, reference desk workers, etc.
* Amateur researchers, including genealogists and other lay people conducting research for their own needs.
* Donors

The Bentley has not made any significant changes to their website since it was first built in the mid-90s. An important resource for researchers that bolsters the university and contributes to it's academic reputation, the site had increasingly fallen short in meeting user needs; it remained in the past as users advanced in terms of their expectations for such a resource. **Staff were concerned by the number of issues experienced by users and time that was spent directing users in using the system, and knew that major changes and improvements were urgently needed.**


## the process

My team conducted a usability study over several months using a diverse range of needs assessment and usability research methodology including **site mapping, stakeholder interviews, user interviews, survey, personas and scenarios, comparative analysis, heuristic evaluation, and user testing.**

We began our process of understanding the Bentley, it's users, and both their needs by **mapping the site**. As a website for an archival repository that has been accumulating content for two decades without any restructuring or redesign, the site map revealed a skeleton that was seriously detached from the apparent structure of the site as visible in the UI.  It gave us early clues to the central issue with the site: It's labyrinthine structure made resources inaccessible to users, and like a bird's nest, did not offer clear paths between areas of content.

**Interviews with stakeholders** at the Bentley, including staff working in each department and high-level administrators, gave us a better sense of users and their needs. We distributed flyers at the Bentley to find participants for **user interviews**, and interviewed a combination of those who responded and a few advanced users recommended by staff. Based upon these conversations we had enough information to create a set of **personas and scenarios** that guided our study and helped to communicate our future recommendations.

To gain additional user data, we **conducted a survey** to assess user needs and feelings about interacting with the Bentley website. The survey, created with Qualtrics, ran for two weeks, and was posted on the Bentley’s website, as well as distributed through our group’s social media and by word of mouth. The majority of respondents were members of academia who utilize the site for research purposes. 

The team then designed survey questions focused around our goals and our interview data. The final draft of our survey consisted of 18 questions and we ran pilot tests to work out any issues. As with our interview findings, our survey findings could be divided into: aspects of the site that users appreciated and aspects of the site that users struggled with. We also discovered that many of the survey responses fell in line with what we learned during the user interviews, further supporting complaints or compliments we had heard previously. 

The Bentley's website was evaluated with the ten heuristics proposed by Jakob Nielsen. This **heuristic evaluation** required three to five evaluators to perform an individual evaluation and assess the severity of findings, and then aggregate and prioritize results across all evaluators to generate recommendations. We generated a list of research questions based upon each heuristic principle, and then each team member independently evaluated the website to determine whether the it adhered to the principles. Then we consolidated findings as a group and gave the most commonly found issues a severity rating on a 0-4 scale.

We conducted a **comparative analysis** of the Bentley website and six other websites across four dimensions: site architecture, navigation/interaction, design/aesthetics, and intended users. The Bentley website does not have direct or indirect competitors, because as a historical library, all of its information is unique. The criteria for selecting comparison products are based on the feedback from our earlier work, as well as an independent study of best practices across a wide variety of similar library websites. Parallel competitors studied were Library, Clarke Historical Library, Library of Congress, Reynolds Historical Library. A partial competitor was Ancestry.com and analogous competitor was Wikipedia. 

We used our four dimensions to explore the corresponding websites. We used the scale of 1-5 (1= low/non-existent; 2 = exists but could be improved; 3 = decent; 4 = great; 5 = excellent) to grade each dimension. We mainly discussed the strengths of each competitor, and compared those strengths to decide the grade of the Bentley website. The rankings were then entered into a matrix and formed the basis of our report.

**Usability testing** allowed our team to better understand the interaction between users and the archive’s website. Researchers use the site for a diverse range of tasks, but each ultimately depends on searching or browsing for material, and our goal was to simulate these tasks and have the results generate new findings and recommendations, or to confirm or correct our findings and recommendations. We asked five participants, ranging from advanced to novice technical researchers, to search for materials or information contained within the Bentley website. The users were given a chance to reflect on their experience by filling out a post-test questionnaire, and we used the testing notes and questionnaires to formulate our final findings and recommendations.

## the result

**Our general findings were:** 1) that users overwhelmingly feel that the Bentley website offers useful information that they appreciate, and they particularly liked the finding aids, 2) the site seems to be designed for experts and staff in terms of structure and language rather than for users and their tasks, 3) the website has some aesthetic issues that complicate users' experience, such as an overwhelming homepage, inconsistent visual cues, and lack of adherence to web accessibility standards, and 4) users struggle with navigating the site and the site needs to provide more guidance or help documentation to assist them in their tasks.

**Our recommendations to the Bentley were:** 1) to continue to provide access to their high-quality collections, digitizing even more material is possible, 2) to work on the site's architecture and language by simplifying terms, explaining them, and orienting them towards the specific tasks users have in mind, 3) to improve visual consistency throughout the site, clearly differentiating separate elements (text, links, etc.), minimize the amount of content on the home page, and improve adherence to web and accessibility standards, and 4) to develop help documentation and arrange site structure to guide users step by step with a small number of clear options.

We presented our findings and recommendation to an audience of staff from across the library, and it was met with a lot of interest and very positive response. The staff was energized by the work we had done, and confident to move forward with their 20+ year old website's first redesign. **Our work formed the roadmap and foundation for the site's beautiful new design, which was released the following year.**
