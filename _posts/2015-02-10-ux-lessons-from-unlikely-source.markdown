My UX guru is somebody you’ve probably never heard of before. His name is Johan Cruyff and he is not a proper UX practitioner of any kind. His extent of technical expertise and computer savvy is probably that of a typical 67 year old who never worked an office job and spent most of their time outdoors. Cruyff is regularly cited as one of the greatest soccer players and managers in history. But he’s my UX guru. 

First, I should explain that I think every talented soccer player or manager would make an equally talented UX designer. The skills to be good at the sport and to truly excel at the game are very similar to those that produce excellent UX chops: The game is about understanding the environment you’re about to enter (analysis of the players involved prior to kick-off is key in the big leagues), anticipation of the actions and needs of everybody around you, speed and the ability to bounce back after a failed attempt, and a meticulous attention to detail balanced with a keen sharpness in every move. They’re also both team sports.

So back to Johan, a man who was exceptionally good, as both a player and manager, at the skills just mentioned. He is Dutch and pioneered, along with a slew of innovative countrymen at the club Ajax in the early 1970s, a style of playing called “total football”. It involved a tactical approach in which every player could and would shift into any position on the field: attack, midfield, or defense. This style required a huge amount of technical proficiency in each player, as together they would manipulate space on the field to collaboratively architect a symphony of passes and ultimately, goals. He eventually took this style of play with him to Barcelona, where as a player and then manager, he influenced future generations of players. He also influenced me: a UX designer and soccer nut.

Cruyff was the master of the soundbite. His nuggets of wisdom (and often absurdity) are some of my favorite lessons to follow as a UX designer. My favorite is:

“Playing football is simple. But playing simple football is the hardest thing there is.”

There you have it. My UX mantra. Designing experiences is simple. But designing simple experiences is the hardest thing there is. The first question I ask of my design work is: “Is there a simpler way?” 99% of the time the answer is “yes”. If a design isn’t difficult to produce, and if it doesn’t take a lot of sweat and stamina to bring it together, with iteration after iteration and even the occasional head pounding, the designer probably isn’t asking this question. But when a simple design is achieved, it should look and feel effortless for the user.

Another favorite: “What is speed? The sports press often confuses speed with insight. See, if I start running slightly earlier than someone else, I seem faster.”

Anticipation and insight are the most essential skill for soccer, as well as UX. I can’t define or explain what makes Lionel Messi do the magic he does on the field: it’s the combination of a rare gift of anticipation and insight and years of obsessive practice and skill development. Fortunately, I have a much better idea of what makes a UX designer have that combination of anticipation and insight. We have a whole wide world of methodology, and to be the Messi of UX, you need to harness these methods, from testing to surveys to creating personas, in an intelligent way so that you can anticipate the behavior of users and know how to design for them. Well before they even realize that they need, you should already be running for the ball.

Sure, these are basic principles of UX design, and I and every other designer should know them well and adhere to our own foundational tactical approaches. Unfortunately, it can be easy to let skills and your focus drift off course, and I look for inspiration in unlikely folks like Cruyff to help me keep my head in the game.
