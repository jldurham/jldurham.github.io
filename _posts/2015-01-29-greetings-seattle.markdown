This month my partner-in-crime and I escaped a midwest blizzard or two and moved ourselves from Ann Arbor to Seattle. It was a difficult decision to leave my job at Shinola, where I’d been a happy and busy UX designer since graduating earlier last year, but my S.O. landed a great job and we decided to settle down in a city where data scientists (like him) and UX designers (like me) have a lot of opportunities both professionally and as a part of our communities of practice. It is also a bonus that the Seattle Sounders are here - we’re both huge soccer fans.

I’ve been spending my first weeks in Seattle exploring our new neighborhood, Capitol Hill, and trying and ranking every coffee shop within a 2 mile radius. While sampling brews from Stumptown to Victrola to Vivace, and falling in love with local gems like Ada’s Technical Books, I’ve also been diving into the job market. It’s been nice to have this time to reflect on my experience since leaving school, to practice new skills, and to think about what I want to accomplish as a UX designer - and where and with whom I’d like to accomplish it. I can’t wait to get started.
