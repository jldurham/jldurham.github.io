## how i work

* project management i have often been at the helm of the whole design life cycle 

* scoping and roadmaps i clearly articulate the process so everybody understands what's required

* goal setting i establish both broad and specific goals and requirements to guide a project

* user research i learn as much as possible about user needs and the context of their use 

* watch  analytics i rely on data to constantly measure the design against it's goals

* personas and scenarios  i summarize research and provide a reference point for those involved

* mapping and models i use to convey high-level concepts and to make structure more concrete

* wireframes  i make sure all requirements are covered in the information, navigation, and interface design

* visual design  i make mock-ups and style guides that either set the design or guide others 

* interactive prototypes  i illustrate the interactions in axure to gather feedback and guide developers
