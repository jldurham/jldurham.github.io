	    <p>i'm a seattle-based UX designer and graduate of the university of michigan's human-computer interaction master's program. i draw upon my experience as a college-level instructor in social science and graduate student in cultural studies to form <span class="red">simple and smart user-centered work that deftly connects with the world that surrounds it.</span></p>
	    <p><span style="font-weight: 700">*what's a culture-ologist?</span> it's a word i've invented to describe people, like me, who are so interested in culture that they get a degree in cultural studies. it's an interdisciplinary field of research that specifically looks to culture, and it's creation, to understand people and society. i've explored the nuts and bolts of new media and digital technology, and how it effects people, which allows me to design experiences that deeply understand users and are sharply attuned to the culture in which they reside.</p>
